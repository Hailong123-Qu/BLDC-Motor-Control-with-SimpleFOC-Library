# BLDC Motor Control with SimpleFOC Library

In this project, we will run the BLDC motor control as a stepper motor instead of running it continuously. In fact, we can call this control system as the control of the gimbal camera called CAT used in unmanned aerial vehicles.

**For Example:**

# 1. Setting up a Library

The library will be required for this work. Because instead of running the engine continuously, we will do intermittent work.
You can access this library setup via the Arduino IDE.

After accessing the Library Manager section and typing in the library section in the search section, download the files that say '**Simple FOC**' and '**SimpleFOCDrivers**' from the 3 libraries that appear.
